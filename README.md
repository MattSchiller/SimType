# Simulated Typing Project

I'll flesh out this a bit more later, but right now this is a project I'm working on to simulate human typing, inclusive of the following features at the moment (escape character: ~:
* Pause [character: p]: followed by the amount of time to sit (in ms), used to simulate the fact that humans don't just crank out characters constantly.
* Delete [character: d]: followed by the number of prior characters to delete, simulating typos and lending a sense of humor/realism to the affair.
* Class [characters: c & C]: followed by -TBD-.

More info as this gets built out!
